I am a Lecturer in Cryptography at the University of Bristol, where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of [Chloe Martindale](https://www.martindale.info/). Before beginning my PhD, I obtained my undergraduate and Master’s degrees in Mathematics from the Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro. My research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, with emphasis on isogeny-based cryptography.
