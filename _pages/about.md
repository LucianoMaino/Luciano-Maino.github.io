I am a lecturer in Cryptography at the University of Bristol, where I also completed my PhD. Before beginning my PhD, I obtained my undergraduate and Master’s degrees in Mathematics from the Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro. My research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, with emphasis on isogeny-based cryptography. 

I am actively involved in the [NIST PQC call for additional digital signature schemes](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig) as a member of the [SQIsign Team](https://sqisign.org/).
